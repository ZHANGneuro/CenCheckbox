# CenCheckbox

CenCheckBox is modified version of BEMCheckBox for MacOS, since BEMCheckBox is designed for iOS platform only. For the current version, only 1 animation (BEMAnimationTypeFlat) is integrated, you can try add more yourself, I will improve this version when I am free. Hope this repository can help someone who wanted to use BEM-style checkbox on MacOS.<br /><br />
